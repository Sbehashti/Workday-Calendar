Creating A Workday Calendar Application For Scheduling Events

I was tasked with refactoring and adding code in order to create a Workday Scheduling Appplication that woul allow an employee of a company to enter and organize data for each hour of the workday from 9am to 5pm. The scheduler also is reset for every new workday and will display the current date at the top of the page.
